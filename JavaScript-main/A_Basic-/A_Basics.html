                        <<<<<<<<<  in java   >>>>>>>>>>>

    String name = "Dasun";  [type is strong ,name can only be assigned string values]
    int age =20;
    boolean state = false;*/

    /*How to make a variable in js

                        <<<<<<<<<  in java script    >>>>>>>>>>>
    */
    //var name = "Hello";
    //typeof  name; //string
    //alert(name);

    /* <----  why js is known as loosely type language ---- > */
    //var name=10; //in here no data type defined before creating the variable,
    //so we can  be assigned anything that we want for the age
    //Because,js is loosely typed language


    //So why js in Dynamic Typing
    //var mySalary = 10000.99;
    //typeof mySalary; // number //->> after assign value for the first time,I will get the type of that value


    // then after that  can be changed it ...?
    //mySalary =true; //assigned another type of value to the previously created variable
    //typeof mySalary; //boolean [now it is changed to boolean ]



    //let's  changed it again
   // mySalary = "No Salary"
    //typeof mySalary; //string [now it is changed to string ]// always dynamically its data type


    //this is why js is known as dynamic scripting language


    /* So , what the trouble we have to face by creating variables using var declaration ype */
    var  myState =false;
    var myState= true; // can duplicate the identifires

    //Does not satisfy the scope
    var myTp=1199;
    {
        console.log(myTp); // this is legal
        var muAge = 100;
    }

    console.log(muAge); //this soud not accecibke  ,but it is
